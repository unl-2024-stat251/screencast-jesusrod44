-   Plot showing average rating of ramen from all countries

    My goal is to get to something like this

    ![](images/worldmaptemplate.jpg)

    It will be black and white probably and instead of pie charts I would be putting down 1-5 stars depending on the ratings.

I plan to use code like mean(ramen_ratings\[Brand == Azami\] to get the average

When making markings on the map, I may try to round up or down the average rating so I don't have to get too technical with half or quarter stars.

```{r}
#Some code that gives me a base for the world map I can tweak to match what I'd like
library(tidyverse)
# create data for world coordinates using
# map_data() function
world_coordinates <- map_data("world")
# create world map using ggplot() function
ggplot() + geom_map( 
    data = world_coordinates, map = world_coordinates, 
    aes(long, lat, map_id = region) 
  )
```

-   How popular some flavors are, ie: cheese, miso, instant ramen, tonkotsu

I'd use some functions like str_detect(variety, "cheese") and filter to get the flavors I'd like, I'll save this in a new variable. I'll find the mean of the ratings with mean(stars) and then use join have all my variables be put in one dataframe

I will have to use mutate(brand = reorder(brand, ratings) to get things flowing from greatest to least on the plot how I want it.

-   Graphs of most and least rated brands

This one is simple. I will use ggplot() and facet_wrap() to make plots of each brand and their ratings.
